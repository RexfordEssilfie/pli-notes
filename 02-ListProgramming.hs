-- List Programming
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

-- Previously, we reviewed basic programming in Haskellâ€“expressions and functions.
-- Over the next two days, we'll review the main programming technique used in any
-- functional programming: recursion.  Because functional programming languages,
-- especially a pure one like Haskell, discourages mutable variables, we must use
-- recursion to get work done.  This is convenient because many algorithms are
-- concisely expressed using recursion.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- A Brief Note on Polymorphic Types
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

-- In Java, we use parametric polymorphism, i.e., generics to make types that
-- are parameterizable by other types.  Haskell provides very lightweight syntax
-- for using polymorphic types.  The type of the standard `length` function over
-- lists is written `[a] -> Int`.  The type of a list of, e.g., integers is
-- written `[Int]`.

-- The length function does not care what the carrier type of the list is, i.e.,
-- the type of elements that the list holds.  We denote this fact by introducing
-- a type variable into the type.  In fact, Haskell will interpret any
-- identifier in a type that begins with a lowercase variable as a type
-- variable, so you can write the following implementation of the polymorphic
-- identity function:

myId :: wee -> wee
myId x = x

-- Where the `wee` in the type is a type variable.  As a matter of style,
-- however, we usually reserve single letter names for polymorphic types,
-- e.g., `a`, `b`, and `m`.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- Functions and Pattern Matching
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

-- We learned that conditionals are part of the expression language.  We can
-- combine conditionals and equality to write recursive functions over lists,
-- e.g., a function that computes the length of a list:

myLength :: (Eq a) => [a] -> Int
myLength l = if l == [] then 0 else 1 + myLength (tail l)

-- Note that `myLength`'s type signature puts a _type class constraint_ on the
-- polymorphic variable `a` because we use equality `(==)` over lists which in
-- turn requires that the `a` implements the `Eq` type class (which provides the
-- `(==)` function).

-- This translation of how we recursively compute the length of a list in Racket
-- into Haskell is not incorrect, but it is not how we would actually write down
-- this recursive function.  Rather than using equality and the `tail` function,
-- we use a powerful programming construct known as _pattern matching_ to get
-- the job done:

myLength' :: [a] -> Int
myLength' []     = 0
myLength' (x:xs) = 1 + myLength' xs

-- You can think of a pattern match as a conditional on the structure of a
-- particular data type.  Here, we are breaking up the definition of `myLength'`
-- (note the apostrophe!) into two cases: when the input list is empty (`[]`)
-- and when the input list is non-empty written using the cons operator
-- (`x:xs`).  Execution of the function proceeds by first determining which of
-- the two patterns match the given input, e.g.,

v1 = myLength' []         -- Evaluates to the first condition and produces 0
v2 = myLength' [1, 2, 3]  -- Evaluates to the second condition, eventually producing 3

-- In the second condition, `x` and `xs` are pattern variables which are bound
-- to the appropriate components of the input list.  For example, we can view
-- the list `[1, 2, 3]` as a sequence of cons operations `1 : (2 : 3 : [])` so
-- `x` becomes bound to `1` and `xs` to `2 : 3 : []` or `[2, 3]`.

-- Finally, note that `myLength'` does not require a type class constraint on
-- the carrier type of list.  This is because we are not actually using the `==`
-- operator.  Instead, Haskell looks directly at the shape of a list to
-- determine which condition of the function to evaluate.  This notion of
-- breaking down a value by its possible shapes is the cornerstone of a language
-- feature we'll discuss next week: algebraic data types.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- Guards
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

-- Pattern matching forms a way to condition the behavior of a function.  It
-- works over the structure of values, however, we are unable to condition on
-- arbitrary behavior of a pattern, e.g., testing if an integer is greater
-- than 0.

-- Haskell provides special syntax, called guards, to capture arbitrary
-- conditions on function alternatives.  For example, here is a Haskell
-- implementation of the Ackermann function (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ackermann_function):

ack :: Int -> Int -> Int
ack m n | m == 0          = n + 1
        | m > 0 && n == 0 = ack (m-1) 1
        | otherwise       = ack (m-1) (ack m (n-1))

-- Guards are simply boolean conditions that are tested to see if a particular
-- function alternative are chosen.  This is really equivalent to an top-level
-- if-expression in the function body, but is arguably much more readable.
-- Compare the `ack` function definition to its formal description on Wikipedia.

-- Exercises
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

-- Fill in the definition of each of the functions below.  For the type
-- signatures of each of the functions, use the most general type possible
-- (read: use polymorphic types and type class constraints whenever possible).

-- 1. Write a function `myAll` that takes list of booleans as input and returns
--    true iff the list only contains `True` values.

all = undefined

-- 2. Write a function `append` that takes two lists (of the same type) as input
--    and returns a new list that is the result of appending the second list onto
--    the end of the first.

append = undefined

-- 3. Write a function `contains` that takes an element and a list and returns
--    `True` iff the element is in the list. (Hint: what type class constraint
--    do you need on the elements of the list to ensure you can compare them for
--    equality?).

contains = undefined

-- 4. Write a function `snoc` that takes an element and a list and appends that
--    element onto the end of the list.

snoc = undefined

-- 5. Write a function `rev` that takes a list and returns a reversed version of
--    that list. (Hint: can you use a previous function to do this?)

rev = undefined
